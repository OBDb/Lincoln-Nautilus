    description: "The first-generation Lincoln Nautilus debuted as a refreshed and renamed version of the second-generation Lincoln MKX, aligning with Lincoln's shift from alphanumeric designations to conventional names. The exterior featured Lincoln's signature mesh grille design, updated LED headlights, and revised styling elements that aligned it with newer Lincoln models like the Navigator and Aviator. Powertrain options included a standard 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 250 horsepower and an available twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 delivering 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission replacing the previous six-speed. The interior maintained the same basic architecture as the MKX but received updates including a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and new SYNC 3 infotainment system with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Premium features included available 22-way adjustable Ultra Comfort seats with massage function, Revel Ultima audio system with 19 speakers, and a panoramic sunroof. Safety technology expanded significantly with the standard Lincoln Co-Pilot360 suite including automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection, lane-keeping system, and automatic high beams, with available Plus package adding adaptive cruise control with lane centering and evasive steering assist. A refresh for 2021 brought a substantially redesigned interior with a new dashboard featuring a coast-to-coast horizontal design, a larger 13.2-inch touchscreen with SYNC 4 infotainment, and updated materials throughout the cabin. The first-generation Nautilus successfully bridged Lincoln's transition to its new design language and naming convention while competing in the highly competitive midsize luxury crossover segment."

The exterior features more fluid styling with a full-width LED light bar, illuminated Lincoln star emblem, and cleaner overall aesthetic compared to its predecessor. Built on a new platform, it offers improved proportions, driving dynamics, and interior space. The standard powertrain is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, while a new hybrid powertrain combines a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor for a total system output of 310 horsepower. The interior showcases Lincoln's most significant technology advancement with a massive 48-inch panoramic display spanning the entire dashboard—the largest display in Lincoln's lineup—complemented by a separate 11.1-inch touchscreen for climate, seat controls, and other vehicle functions. This curved OLED display features high-resolution graphics and can be configured to show different information based on driver preference. Premium appointments include available 24-way Perfect Position front seats with massage function, 28-speaker Revel Ultima 3D audio system, and high-quality materials throughout the cabin. Advanced driver assistance comes standard through Lincoln Co-Pilot360 2.0 with available ActiveGlide hands-free highway driving capability on pre-mapped routes. The Black Label trim offers exclusive interior themes, premium materials, and unique ownership privileges. The second-generation Nautilus elevates Lincoln's midsize luxury crossover offering with distinctive technology, refined design, and electrified powertrain options, competing directly with established luxury competitors while offering a uniquely American take on modern luxury."
